<h1>The Best Films I Remember</h1>
<h2>The 3 films I have seen recently which stayed with me</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Suzhou River</h3>
<p>
  Guerilla style idiosyncratic film-making, engaging, and heart-breaking, love
  story, yet never lets the viewer settle.
</p>
<h3>Drive My Car</h3>
<p>
  Beautiful, understated, story about grief, guilt, and companionship. Says a
  lot with just enough words and no more.
</p>
<h3>Lady MacBeth</h3>
<p>
  Sublime performance from Florence Pugh in her "breakout" role. Claustrophobic,
  uncomfortable, unnerving, without ever having to utilise too much viscera.
